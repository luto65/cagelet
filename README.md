Captcha are cool, captcha are "kult", eveveryone wants a Captcha in own logo! However most captcha are made on server (what's the point otherwise) and therefore people can't build their own.

In this pages I've build

an applet CageleApplet
an application java -cp Cagele.jar org.toldo.CageleApp

a JNLP startup CageleApp

The core of the work, however, has not been done by myself. Therefore the name of this page: CAGElet.

Yes, I rely on the great CAGE library that akiraly made few years ago https://github.com/akiraly/cage
